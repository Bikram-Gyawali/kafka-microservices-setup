# Kafka Service Communication Setup  

This project implements a Kafka-based communication system in a microservices architecture.  

## Features  

- **Kafka & Zookeeper** for service-to-service communication.  
- **API Gateway** for handling client requests.  
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database.  
- **Microservices (Service A & Service B)** for processing messages.  
- **Dockerized Setup** with managed services and API Gateway.  
- **Environment-based Logging** for better debugging.  
- **Environment Variables Handling** for configuration management.  
- **Cron Job Execution** every 5 minutes to summarize user messages.
- **Working on monorepo setup**
